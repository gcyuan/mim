[MIM: Motif Independet Metric - Luca Pinello]

This software calculates a measure of sequence specificity called Motif Independent Metric. 

[INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS]

In order to use the MIM software you need:

-Python 2.7(http://www.python.org/getit/) 

and the following modules:

-Numpy (http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.6.1/)
-Scipy (http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.9.0/)

Note: 
If you are using  64bit version Python on Windows you can download the 64 bit version of these modules from:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

[USAGE]

The program takes as input:

1) A proper BED file (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1) containing the coordinates of your sequences for some genome of reference

2) The fasta files of your genome of reference (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html)

To launch the program from a shell type:

python mim.py bed_file.bed /path_to_your_genome_directory/

To see a list of the optional arguments with a short explanation, please just type:

python mim.py

At the end of the execution the program will report the MIM value for the sequences extracted from the bed file and its p-value.

[Testing the software]
You can test the software with the provide bed sample file(sample_hg18.bed) and the human genome (hg18) fasta files from here:
